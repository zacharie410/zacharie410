# Zacharie - Programmer
Hello, I'm Zacharie, a passionate programmer with interests in AI, cybersecurity, and network architectures. With years of experience in the tech industry, I have worked on various projects, including state machine NPC modules and server management utilities.


## Approach
I believe in continuous learning and growth through collaborative work on challenging projects. My approach is focused on attention to detail, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to adapt to various project requirements.

## Skillset
My experience includes software engineering, AI, cybersecurity, and network architectures. I possess a solid foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and design patterns, as well as the ability to write efficient and reliable code.

## Memorable Experience
One of my most memorable experiences was working on securing customer data on a large-scale network. Despite facing unexpected challenges, including a persistent cyber attack that threatened to compromise the network, our team was able to develop and implement a robust security system that greatly enhanced the network's defenses.

## Let's Connect!
I am always open to collaborating on new projects and expanding my network. If you are interested in working together or would like to discuss new ideas, feel free to reach out to me:
