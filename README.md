## Memorable Experience
One of my most memorable experiences was working on a state machine NPC module for a video game. Despite facing unexpected challenges, including a persistent bug that kept causing test NPCs to disappear, our team persevered and delivered a fully functional module that greatly enhanced the game's AI.
